    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy and aromatic dish is a reflection on the flavours used within Palestine. The nutty tahini combines wonderfully with the butter, garlic and lemon to bring out the best from such a tasty and tender white fish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 x 400g Sea Bream Cleaned, Gutted and De-scaled</li>
        <li>100g Pine Nuts</li>
        <li>3 Large Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>1 Medium Lemon</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Tahini</li>
        <li>50g Salted Butter</li>
        <li>1 large Handful of Parsley</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Harissa</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 160 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, combine garlic, tahini, oil, lemon juice, parsley, harissa, butter, and 50g of pine nuts. Blitz until the mixture is smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Smother the insides and outsides of the fish with the creamy mixture, making sure to massage the sauce all over.</li>
        <li>Bake the fish in the oven for 25 minutes until the sauce is thicker and beginning to caramelize.</li>
        <li>Just before the fish is ready, dry fry the remaining pine nuts in a frying pan until golden brown and sprinkle them over the fish.</li>
        <li>This dish tastes great with salad, rice, or couscous, and a dash of plain yogurt and lemon. It's recommended to serve the fish on a bed of fresh spinach.</li>
        <li>Tip: Sea bream is ideally purchased from a market or fishmonger as a wild-caught fish, with a minimum weight of 400g per fish when possible.</li>
