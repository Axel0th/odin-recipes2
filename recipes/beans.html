    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You can make this recipe with okra, but I prefer it with string beans – some countries, Lebanon in particular, use butter beans. You may have to use a few more pans than you would like to, but the end result is just divine. Like my mother, I try to bring different foods, tastes and styles into my home, to feed my family and friends. Even if they are not used to eating it, or have never tried it, they always love the flavours. Rice is the usual accompaniment for this dish with some green chilli and green pepper. Some family traditions should never be lost and this one, I hope, will be one of those dishes that is made and remembered for its simplicity of ingredients and its greatness of flavour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 onions, 1 quartered and 2 chopped</li>
        <li>500g (1lb 2oz) lamb neck or lamb fillet, cubed</li>
        <li>150ml (5fl oz) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 whole head of garlic, cloves crushed</li>
        <li>500g (1lb 2oz) fine string beans</li>
        <li>1kg (2¼ lb) tomato passata</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato purée</li>
        <li>1 quantity of Vermicelli Rice</li>
        <li>1 quantity of Vermicelli Rice</li>
        <li>green chilli, chopped sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>- Fill a saucepan with boiling water, add 2 teaspoons of salt, and set it over high heat.</li>
        <li>- Add the quartered onion and lamb to the boiling water and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>- Remove any scum that appears on the surface during boiling, repeating until no more scum appears.</li>
        <li>- Let the mixture simmer for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>- In another saucepan, heat vegetable oil and sauté chopped onions and garlic gently for about 10 minutes until soft but not browned.</li>
        <li>- Add string beans to the sautéed onions and garlic, turn the heat down, and let them cook gently for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>- After 40 minutes, remove the meat from the first pan and reserve the liquid for a flavorful sauce.</li>
        <li>- Once the beans have cooked, add passata with half of the cooking liquor from the lamb. Ensure that the beans are cooked before adding the tomato sauce, as the acidity in the tomato may hinder further bean cooking.</li>
        <li>- Stir in tomato purée and add the reserved meat. Let the mixture simmer for 30 minutes over medium heat.</li>
        <li>- Check for flavor and add a little salt if needed, as the tomato purée can be a bit sour.</li>
        <li>- Continue cooking over medium heat while you begin to cook Vermicelli Rice.</li>
        <li>- When the rice is cooked, you are ready to serve.</li>
        <li>- Place a generous amount of Vermicelli Rice in a serving bowl and ladle over the terracotta-colored lamb stew.</li>
        <li>- Let it cool slightly before serving and serve with green pepper and chili. Enjoy to your heart's content!</li>
